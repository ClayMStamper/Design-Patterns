Observer Pattern

- When you need many other object to receive an update when another object updates
    - Stock market
        - Subject (publisher) : sends many stocks to the observers
        - Observers (subscribers) takes the ones they want and use them
- The Observer pattern  is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

Model:

- <interface>Subject
    - +Register (Observer) : void
    - +Unregister (Observer) : void
    - +NotifyObserver() : void
- <interface> Observer
    - +Update() : void
